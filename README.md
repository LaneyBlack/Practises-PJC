# Practises-PJC
Basics of C - Practices from PJATK (2st semester)

Every "/c*" file is dedicated to every practise lesson (cwiczenia=exersice).
Here you can see just some homeworks and exersises done.
Every s24382.cpp file in every exersise (s24382 is my student number) is a test at the start of a lesson.
